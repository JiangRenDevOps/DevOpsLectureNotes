If you use the pre-built vagrant box, docker should be already there.

# Tasks: Docker registry demos

## 1. Apply a Dockerhub account
https://hub.docker.com/

## 2. Login to the account

e.g. Dockerfile
```
FROM ubuntu

ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash"]
CMD ["-c", "echo Hello world from your_name"] 

```

## 4. Build an image

```
docker build -t your_docker_account_name/test:1.0 .
```

## 5. Push the image
```
docker push your_docker_account_name/test:1.0
```

## 6. Pull your teammate's image
```
