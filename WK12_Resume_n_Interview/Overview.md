# DevOps Overview

## DevOps Engineer

### What is it? 
DevOps is a software development strategy which bridges the gap between the developers and the IT staff. With DevOps, organizations can release small features very quickly and incorporate the feedback which they receive, very quickly. Following are some other benefits:

* Fewer Software Failure
* Shortened lead time between fixes

* Git and GitHub – Source code management (Version Control System)
* Jenkins – Automation server, with plugins built for developing CI/ CD pipelines
* Selenium – Automation testing
* Docker – Software Containerization Platform
* Kubernetes – Container Orchestration tool
* Terraform (Ansible) – Configuration Management and Deployment
* Prometheus (Grafana, NewRelic, Nagios) – Continuous Monitoring

### What are the job titles?
* DevOps Engineer
* Cloud Engineer

Other job titles:
* System Engineer
* Automation Engineer
* Integration Specialist
* Release Manager

### Salary Range

* Base: 83k - 138k; Avg: 105k  --- Glass door Feb 2020


### Some statistics


### Why do companies need DevOps engineer?
* Reliably running the application and delivery of code and features 
* Reduce the companies operational overheads and toils by providing better automation and tooling to boost the efficiency
* Set up the monitoring, alerts and update runbooks to share the best practice 
* Improve communication and collaboration, especially for incident management

Improved Efficiency 
* --> Had more time to add more values to the business --> Improved Productivity 
* --> Improved Opex --> Cost less to the business 



### Required Education
* __Required__: Individuals will need a bachelor's degree in computer science, engineering, or a related field, with some employers preferring a master's degree.
* __Beneficial__: A strong background in automated application testing, server configuration management, and scripting will be __beneficial__. 
* __Nice to Have__: DevOps engineers can showcase their proficiency in the field by completing the Certified DevOps Engineer offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). These engineers may also consider membership in an industry organization like the DevOps Agile Skills Association (DASA).



### Examples
Key takeaways from the job description (DevOps Skills Required):

* Knowledge of one cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP)
* Good hands-on knowledge of Configuration Management and Deployment tools like – Puppet, Ansible, Chef, Terraform etc.
* Proficient in scripting, and Git and Git workflows
* Experience in developing Continuous Integration/ Continuous Delivery pipelines (CI/ CD)


# Interview Overview
- Online Test
- Phone Screening
- Coding Interview
- Technical Interview
- Culture/Managerial Interview

## Online Test
### What is this test about?
- A url with a coding test via email (e.g.Hackerrank) 
- 2 to 3 questions 
- 60 to 90 minutes

### How to judge success?
- Once you submit, there will be a set of tests that will be running against your code to evaluate.

### What does it test?
- Attitude
- Basic data structure and algorithms (e.g. You said you know how to use Python, do you really?)
- Work under pressure
- Able to cover corner cases

### Why online test?
- Filter out the elites from the majorities (help balance HR's workload)

### Tips
- Make sure you think twice about the corner cases
- Make sure you think about time vs space complexity when you pick your data structure and algorithm
- Make sure you don't have the +1 or -1 problem when you access index
- No Null Pointer Exceptions (NPE) please
- Be sure to know the best practice and formats of your coding language
- Use explicit variable names as much as possible
- Grads interview could be harder than a social one
- Some trading companies' interview questions could be challenging


## Resume
You probably have noticed that the online test is not too difficult, but you may still get an rejection letter.
One of reasons is that you resume did not get picked. 

- __Typos and Grammatical Errors__
  * Download Grammarly and use it to check your grammar mistakes
- __Lack of Specifics__
  
  What is the problem with the following sentences
  * e.g. Worked on xxx software project using Python, VMware, etc..
  * e.g. I am good at Python, Java, JS and know CI/CD 
  
- Attempting One Size Fits All
  * Tailor your resume for different roles
  * The HR wants to see you fit the role
  
- Highlighting Duties Instead of Accomplishments
  
  It's easy to slip into a mode where you simply start listing job duties on your resume. For example:
     
    * Attended group meetings and recorded minutes.
    * Worked with children in a day-care setting.
    * Updated departmental files.
  
  Employers, however, don't care so much about what you've done as what you've accomplished in your various activities. They're looking for statements more like these:
 
    * Used laptop computer to record weekly meeting minutes and compiled them in a Microsoft Word-based file for future organizational reference.
    * Developed three daily activities for preschool-age children and prepared them for a 10-minute holiday program performance.
    * Reorganized 10 years worth of unwieldy files, making them easily accessible to department members.
    
  The golden format: Verb + ed sth for A and B by doing/via/using sth 

- Going on Too Long or Cutting Things Too Short
  * Two page max
  * Put the best fit achievements to the top of each section 
        * (Summary (Object, Tech Stack), Work Experience, Project Experience, Education, Awards, (Referrers) )
  * You don't necessarily need to put the referrers' info
- A Bad Objective

- No Action Verbs
  * Avoid using phrases like "responsible for." Instead, use action verbs: "Resolved user questions as part of an IT help desk serving 4,000 students and staff."
- Leaving off Important Information
  * You may be tempted, for example, to eliminate mention of the jobs you've taken to earn extra money for school. Typically, however, the soft skills you've gained from these experiences (e.g., work ethic, time management) are more important to employers than you might think.

- Visually Too Busy
  * Use simple sentences
  * Use bullet points 
  * Show multiple people 

- Contact Info
  * Make sure they are correct

## Technical Interview

This is a typical interview to test the depth and breath of your knowledge.
The questions are rather open to let you design a system or debug an issue and improve upon it.
Also, it is possible that the interviewers ask you about the projects that you did and expand the questions from there.
* Ask questions to define the scope
* Break things down and follow a logic flow (Top-down, bottom-up, upstream to downstream, downstream to upstream)
* Breadth is good, but make sure you prepare something deep. e.g. a common issue for prometheus, it does not work with a multithreaded server directly. 


## Culture/Managerial Interview

### Behavioural Questions

The purpose of behavioural interview questions is to understand who you are, how you think, and how you approach real world dilemmas. Your answers to these behavioural questions can help the interviewer gauge how you may (or may not) complement the current team.

While the goal of the interviewer is to learn more about you, your goal is to position yourself in the best possible light.

Let’s take a look at the six most common behavioural questions you may encounter during your interview, along with a plan for how to answer them below.

* Describe a time when you disagreed with a team member. How did you resolve the problem?
* Tell me about a time when you failed.
* Give me an example of when you had to assume leadership for a team.
* What is the most difficult/ challenging situation you’ve ever had to resolved in the workplace?
* Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a supervisor.
* How do you approach problems? What’s your process?

Also, most behavioural interview questions can be separated into groups:
* Problem Solving
* Working on a Team
* Biggest Failures
* Leadership
* Personal Stress

Answering strategy:
STAR - Situation - Task - Action - Result



### Hypothetical interview questions
It is about what characteristics do you have and what values would you add to the team?
* Role Play
* There are certain characteristics that you must have (Integrity, Openness, Honesty)
